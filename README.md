This project is simply about printing out the days or the full calendar of august 2005. Firstly i imported Calendar as a library. This calendar consist of the 12
months of the year. i used a user_input option which allowed the user to enter both the year and the month of choice. made sure to convert my user_input data type to 
integer because our month and year are integer values. i finally used the print function to print out my output.
